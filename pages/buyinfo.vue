              My main specialisations orientated around 3D printing and 3D
              design if you need a fursuit base fursuit parts mechanical parts
              for fursuit eyes I am open to people's ideas I can also do like
              finishing and painting if need be.
            </p>
            <p>I do have a few basic things I do sell as listed below</p>

            <p>
              $75 for a pre-made base from an existing stock
            </p>
            <p>
              $100 for me to spend the time to design you a base based on your
              criteria, with the condition that your base once completed is free
              to people to buy for the tier above.
            </p>
            <p>
              $350 for a true one-of-a-kind base owned purely by you you even
              get to keep the file for personal use
            </p>
            <p>
              +$50 if you opt for semi flexible tpu which has the advantage of
              making it more crush resistance as well as slightly softing
              compared to petg
              <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-My4eJFZ4F">example here</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              +$30 for realistic base it's a little out of my comfort zone but I
              can manage.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also make other thing such a goggles and anything you wish to
              ask just DM me.
