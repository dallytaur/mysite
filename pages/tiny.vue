            I am glad you spent the time to watch the video and click on my link
            as of now I have a few things that I can make for you

            <br />

            you can purchase a fully assembled base of the dragon puppet that
            you see in tiny's video assuming that is been released yet

            <br />
            I also sell the fursuit based used and such as the adorable opossum
            I also make custom basis if you wish
            <br />
            currently I sell them into materials petg or tpu
            <br />
            <br />

            <img src="/img/opbase.jpg" alt="base" height="200" />

            As of now I have three tiers.
            <br />
            <br />
            $75 for a pre-made base from an existing stock
            <br />
            <br />

            $100 for me to spend the time to design you a base based on your
            criteria, with the condition that your base once completed is free
            to people to buy for the tier above.
            <br />
            <br />

            $350 for a true one-of-a-kind base owned purely by you you even get
            to keep the file for personal use

            <br />
            <br />

            +$50 if you opt for semi flexible tpu which has the advantage of
            making it more crush resistance as well as slightly softing compared
            to petg
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-My4eJFZ4F">example here</a>
            <br />
            <br />
            +$30 for realistic base it's a little out of my comfort zone but I
            can manage.
            <br />
            <br />
            all bases come with moving jaw as well as integrated hinge system
            feel free to opt out if you wish to not have moving jaw
            <br />
            <br />
            I also design custom bits and pieces for your design work if you
            need stuff like horns, mechanical parts, eye parts and so on you can
            also message me for custom things as well.
            <br />
