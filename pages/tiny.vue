                    I am glad you spent the time to watch the video and click on my link as of now I have a few things
                    that
                    I can make for you

                    <br>

                    you can purchase a fully assembled base of the dragon puppet that you see in tiny's video assuming
                    that
                    is been released yet

                    <br>
                    I also sell the fursuit based used and such as the adorable opossum I also make custom basis if you
                    wish
                    <br>
                    currently I sell them into materials petg or tpu
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  </div>

                  <img src="/img/base.jpg" alt="base" height="200">
                </div>
                As of now I have three tiers.
                <br>
                <br>
                $75 for a pre-made base from an existing stock
                <br>
                <br>

                $125 for me to spend the time to design you a base based on your criteria, with the condition that
                your base once completed is free to people to buy for the tier above.
                <br>
                <br>

                $350 for a true one-of-a-kind base owned purely by you you even get to keep the file for personal use

                <br>
                <br>

                +$50 if you opt for semi flexible tpu which has the advantage of making it more crush resistance as
                well as slightly softing compared to petg
                <br>
                <br>
                +$30 for realistic base it's a little out of my comfort zone but I can manage.
                <br>
                <br>
                all bases come with moving jaw as well as integrated hinge system feel free to opt out if you wish to
                not have moving jaw
                <br>
                <br>
                I also design custom bits and pieces for your design work if you need stuff like horns, mechanical
                parts, eye parts and so on you can also message me for custom things as well.
